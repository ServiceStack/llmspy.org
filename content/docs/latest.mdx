### Standard Input

`llms` now accepts [OpenAI-compatible Chat Completion requests](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) via standard input, making it easy to integrate into shell pipelines and scripts.

When JSON is piped in, `llms` detects it automatically — no extra flags needed:

```bash
cat request.json | llms
```

Build requests inline with a heredoc:

```bash
llms <<EOF
{
  "model": "Minimax M2.5",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "Capital of France?" }
  ]
}
EOF
```

Combine with other CLI tools to generate requests dynamically:

```bash
echo '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Summarize:'"$(cat notes.txt)"'"}]}' | llms
```

This pairs well with structured outputs support and `jq` to build end-to-end JSON pipelines:

```bash
(llms <<EOF
{
    "model": "moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role":"user", "content":"Return capital cities for: France, Italy, Spain, Japan." }],
    "response_format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "country_capitals",
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "capitals": {
                        "type": "array",
                        "items": {
                            "type": "object",
                            "properties": {
                                "country": { "type": "string" },
                                "capital": { "type": "string" }
                            },
                            "required": ["country","capital"]
                        }
                    }
                },
                "required": ["capitals"]
            }
        }
    }
}
EOF
) | jq -r '.capitals[] | "\(.country): \(.capital)"'
```

Output:

```
France: Paris
Italy: Rome
Spain: Madrid
Japan: Tokyo
```

### Persistence Options

By default, all chat completions are saved to the database, including both the chat thread (conversation history) and the individual API request logs. 
Use these options to control what gets saved to the database:

#### `--nohistory`

Skip saving the **chat thread** (conversation history) to the database. The individual API **request log** is still recorded.

```sh
llms "What is the capital of France?" --nohistory
```

#### `--nostore`

Do not save **anything** to the database - no request log and no chat thread history. Implies `--nohistory`.

```sh
llms "What is the capital of France?" --nostore
```

### Custom User and Agent Avatars

Personalize your chat experience with [custom avatars](/docs/configuration/avatars) for both yourself and AI agents. Upload images via the Settings page or manually add them to `~/.llms/users/` - supports `.png`, `.svg`, and auto-converts from other formats.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'User Avatar': '/img/features/avatars-settings.webp',
    'Agent Avatar': '/img/features/avatars-chat.webp',
}} />

### Compact Tool Calls with Smart Summarization

The new **Compact Tool Calls** feature automatically summarizes long tool arguments and outputs in the Chat UI to keep conversations concise while still providing access to important information as needed.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Tools Expanded': '/img/features/tools-expanded.webp',
    'Tools Collapsed': '/img/features/tools-collapsed.webp',
}} />

Previously, even with long Tool Call Arguments minimized, you could still only see a few on a page. Now that they're collapsed by default, you can see more at a glance and expand only the ones you need.

### Support for Voice Input

Added [Voice Input](/docs/features/voice-input) extension with speech-to-text transcription via a microphone button or `ALT+D` shortcut, supporting three modes: local transcription with **voxtype**, custom **transcribe** executable, and cloud-based **voxtral-mini-latest** via Mistral.

<Screenshot src="/img/features/voice-recording.webp"  />

- Added **tok/s** metrics in Chat UI on a per-message and per-thread basis

## Feb 5, 2026

### Voxtral Audio Models

Added support for Mistral's [Voxtral audio transcription models](https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral-transcribe-2) - use the **audio** input filter in the model selector to find them.

<Screenshot src="/img/models/voxtral-models.webp"  />

Both the **Chat Completion** and dedicated **Audio Transcription** APIs deliver impressive speed, with the dedicated transcription endpoint returning results near-instantly.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Voxtral Chat': '/img/models/voxtrals-chat.webp',
    'Voxtral Audio Transcription': '/img/models/voxtrals-audio-transcription.webp',
}} />

### Compact Threads

Added [Compact Threads feature](/docs/features/chat-ui#compact-feature) for managing long conversations - it summarizes the current thread into a new, condensed thread targeting **30%** of the original context size. The compact button appears when a conversation exceeds **10 messages** or uses more than **40%** of the model's context limit. 

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Compact Button': '/img/compact-button.webp',
    'Compact Button Intensity': '/img/compact-intensity.webp',
}} />

The compaction model and prompts are fully customizable in `~/.llms/llms.json`.

- Fix **OpenRouter** provider after [models.dev](https://models.dev) switched to use `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`. Remove `llms.json` to reset to default configuration:

<ShellCommand>rm ~/.llms/llms.json</ShellCommand>

## Feb 3, 2026

- Removed duplicate filesystem tools from [Core Tools](/docs/features/core-tools), they're now only included in [File System Tools](/docs/features/core-tools#file-system-tools)

- Add `sort_by` and `max_result` options in `search_files` and made `path` and optional parameter to improve utility and reduce tool use error rates. `path` now defaults to the first allowed directory (project dir).

## Feb 3, 2026

- Add support for overridable  **ClientTimeout** limits in `~/.llms/llms.json`:

```json
{
    "limits": {
        "client_timeout": 120
    }
}
```

- Show **proceed** button for assistant messages without content but with reasoning

## Feb 2, 2026

### Multi User Skills

When Auth is enabled, each user [manages their own skill collection](/docs/extensions/skills#multi-user-skills) at `~/.llms/user/<user>/skills` and can enable or disable skills independently. Shared global & project-level skills remain accessible but read-only.

## Jan 31, 2026

- Refactor [GitHub Auth](/docs/deployment/github-oauth) out into a builtin [github_auth](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/tree/main/llms/extensions/github_auth) extension

## Jan 30, 2026

- Support for **tool calling** for models returned by local **Ollama** instances

- New `openai-local` provider for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints

- Fix computer tool issues in Docker by only loading computer tool if run in environment with a display

## Jan 29, 2026

### Skills Management

Added a full [Skills Management UI](/docs/extensions/skills) for creating, editing, and deleting skills directly from the browser. 

Skills package domain-specific instructions, scripts, references & assets that enhance your AI agent.

<Screenshot src="/img/skills/skills-edit-page.webp"  />

### Browse & Install Skills

Added a [Skill Browser](/docs/extensions/skills#browsing-and-installing-skills) with access to the top 5,000 community skills from [skills.sh](http://skills.sh). Search, browse, and install pre-built skills directly into your personal collection.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Browse Skills': '/img/skills/skills-browse.webp',
    'Installing Skill': '/img/skills/skills-installing.webp',
}} />

## Jan 28, 2026

- Use a barebones fallback markdown render when [markdown renders like KaTex](/docs/features/katex) fail

- Use `sanitizeHtml` to avoid breaking layout when displaying rendered html

## Jan 26, 2026

- Add copy button to **TextViewer** popover menu

- Add **proceed** and **retry** buttons at the bottom of Threads to continue agent loop

- Add [filesystem tools](/docs/features/core-tools#file-system-tools) in [computer](/docs/extensions/computer_use) extension

- Add a simple `sendUserMessage` API in UI to simulate a new user message on the thread

- Implement `TextViewer` component for displaying Tool Args, Tool Output + SystemPrompt

## Jan 24, 2026
