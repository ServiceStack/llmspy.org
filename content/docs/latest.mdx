### Compact Tools with Smart Summarization

The new **Compact Tools** feature automatically summarizes long tool arguments and outputs in the Chat UI to keep conversations concise while still providing access to important information as needed.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Tools Expanded': '/img/features/tools-expanded.webp',
    'Tools Collapsed': '/img/features/tools-collapsed.webp',
}} />

Previously, even with long Tool Call Arguments minimized, you could still only see a few on a page. Now that they're collapsed by default, you can see more at a glance and expand only the ones you need.

### Support for Voice Input

Added [Voice Input](/docs/features/voice-input) extension with speech-to-text transcription via a microphone button or `ALT+D` shortcut, supporting three modes: local transcription with **voxtype**, custom **transcribe** executable, and cloud-based **voxtral-mini-latest** via Mistral.

- Added **tok/s** metrics in Chat UI on a per-message and per-thread basis

### Voxtral Audio Models

Added support for Mistral's [Voxtral audio transcription models](https://mistral.ai/news/voxtral-transcribe-2) - use the **audio** input filter in the model selector to find them.

<Screenshot src="/img/models/voxtral-models.webp"  />

Both the **Chat Completion** and dedicated **Audio Transcription** APIs deliver impressive speed, with the dedicated transcription endpoint returning results near-instantly.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Voxtral Chat': '/img/models/voxtrals-chat.webp',
    'Voxtral Audio Transcription': '/img/models/voxtrals-audio-transcription.webp',
}} />

### Compact Threads

Added [Compact Threads feature](/docs/features/chat-ui#compact-feature) for managing long conversations - it summarizes the current thread into a new, condensed thread targeting **30%** of the original context size. The compact button appears when a conversation exceeds **10 messages** or uses more than **40%** of the model's context limit. 

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Compact Button': '/img/compact-button.webp',
    'Compact Button Intensity': '/img/compact-intensity.webp',
}} />

The compaction model and prompts are fully customizable in `~/.llms/llms.json`.

- Fix **OpenRouter** provider after [models.dev](https://models.dev) switched to use `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`. Remove `llms.json` to reset to default configuration:

<ShellCommand>rm ~/.llms/llms.json</ShellCommand>

## Feb 3, 2026

- Removed duplicate filesystem tools from [Core Tools](/docs/features/core-tools), they're now only included in [File System Tools](/docs/features/core-tools#file-system-tools)

- Add `sort_by` and `max_result` options in `search_files` and made `path` and optional parameter to improve utility and reduce tool use error rates. `path` now defaults to the first allowed directory (project dir).

## Feb 3, 2026

- Add support for overridable  **ClientTimeout** limits in `~/.llms/llms.json`:

```json
{
    "limits": {
        "client_timeout": 120
    }
}
```

- Show **proceed** button for assistant messages without content but with reasoning

### Multi User Skills

When Auth is enabled, each user [manages their own skill collection](/docs/extensions/skills#multi-user-skills) at `~/.llms/user/<user>/skills` and can enable or disable skills independently. Shared global & project-level skills remain accessible but read-only.

## Jan 31, 2026

- Refactor [GitHub Auth](/docs/deployment/github-oauth) out into a builtin [github_auth](https://github.com/ServiceStack/llms/tree/main/llms/extensions/github_auth) extension

## Jan 30, 2026

- Support for **tool calling** for models returned by local **Ollama** instances

- New `openai-local` provider for custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints

- Fix computer tool issues in Docker by only loading computer tool if run in environment with a display

## Jan 29, 2026

### Skills Management

Added a full [Skills Management UI](/docs/extensions/skills) for creating, editing, and deleting skills directly from the browser. 

Skills package domain-specific instructions, scripts, references & assets that enhance your AI agent.

<Screenshot src="/img/skills/skills-edit-page.webp"  />

### Browse & Install Skills

Added a [Skill Browser](/docs/extensions/skills#browsing-and-installing-skills) with access to the top 5,000 community skills from [skills.sh](http://skills.sh). Search, browse, and install pre-built skills directly into your personal collection.

<ScreenshotsGallery className="mb-8" gridClass="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4" images={{
    'Browse Skills': '/img/skills/skills-browse.webp',
    'Installing Skill': '/img/skills/skills-installing.webp',
}} />
